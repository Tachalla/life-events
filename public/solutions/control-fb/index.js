/**
 * Exercise:
 *
 * Get to know your control flow and iteration
 *
 * Complete the three (+1 bonus) exercises (below)
 * using the following browser based functions:
 * 
 * 1. alert()
 *   alert("Message string"); 
 * Alert a message to the user
 *
 * 2. prompt()
 *   var val = prompt("Question string?");
 * will prompt the user for a value and return the value
 * 
 * 3. confirm()
 *   confirm("Message string"); 
 * will ask the user to confirm with an ok, or cancel, returning a boolean
 *
 * Hint:
 * Work in the console, or use "console.log()" 
 * to output to the console from the script
 */

// 1) 
// Ask the user for a number (using prompt())
// Tell the user if it is even or odd (using alert())
// (hint: prompt() will always return a string)
// (hint: the modulo operator, %, can help determine oddness or evenness)

// your solution to #1 here

// 2)
// Ask the user how old they are (using prompt())
// If they are 70 or older, tell them they look great.
// If they are 18 or younger, tell them they should be in school.
// If they are between those ages, tell them to get a job.

// your solution to #2 here

// 3) 
// We have an array of values
// Use a while() statement to go through each value of the array
// and add 1 to each number (but not strings)
// log the resulting array to the console

var myArray = [1,2,3,"Interlocutor", 4,5,6];

// your solution to #3 here


// 4) Bonus
// Make an array of people's names
// Use a for statement to go through each and combine
// them into a single string separated by commas
// Log the result to the console.
// ex result: "John, Sally, Nick"

// your solution to #4 here
