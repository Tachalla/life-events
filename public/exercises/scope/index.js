 * Exercise:
 *
 * Function Scope
 *
 * Using "console.log()" to output to the console 
 * from the script to verify your solutions
 *
 * You could also use console.assert(boolean) to test your functions
 *
 * Part 1: 
 * Write two functions that share the same, global variable
 * Verify this by logging the value of the variable to the console 
 * from within each function

 */
 
 // write solution to part 1 here
 
 /*
 * Part 2: 
 * Write two functions that share a non-global variable
 * Verify this by logging the value of the variable to the console 
 * from within each function
 *
 * Hint: You can write functions inside of other functions...
 */
 
 // write solution to part 2 here
 
 
/*
 * Bonus: Write a function (outer) that returns another function (inner)
 *
 * The outer function expects one Number parameter, x
 * The inner function should add 1 to x and log it to the console
 * 
 * Hint: You will need to run the outer function once
 * in order to get the inner function
